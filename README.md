# Heart Disease Prediction using Hybrid Deep Learning Model

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using a **hybrid deep learning model** combining **GoogLeNet** and **AlexNet**.  
It was developed in **Google Colab** as part of my academic work in Mathematics.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
- Data balancing using **SMOTE**
- Feature scaling with **RobustScaler**
- Hybrid deep learning architecture for improved performance
- Model training and evaluation with **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **Scikit-learn**
- Performance comparison with individual models

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset contains ~300,000 samples and 18 features from a heart disease dataset.

## ðŸ›  Requirements
If running locally:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow torch opencv-python matplotlib
Or run directly in Google Colab without installation.

ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance
Hybrid model achieved 3% higher accuracy compared to using GoogLeNet or AlexNet individually.
